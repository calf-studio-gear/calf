.SH NAME
calfjackhost \- JACK wrapper for Calf plugins
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B calfjackhost [\fIoptions\fR] \fIplugin[:preset]\fR [\fB!\fR] ...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Calf JACK host application provides a way to use Calf plugins directly, without need for any external host application. It also offers best GUI functionality (using GTK+ 2 widget set), as there is no restrictive plugin standard getting in a way between GUI and audio processing code.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-c --client\fR \fIname\fR
sets JACK client name (the name calfjackhost uses when registering in JACK)
.TP
\fB-i --input\fR \fIname\fR
name prefix for audio inputs
.TP
\fB-o --output\fR \fIname\fR
name prefix for audio outputs
.TP
\fB-m --midi\fR \fIname\fR
name prefix for MIDI inputs
.TP
\fB-c --connect-midi\fR \fIclient:port\fR
automatically connect all MIDI ports to \fIclient:port\fR
.TP
\fB-M --connect-midi\fR \fB!\fIn\fR
automatically connect all MIDI ports to \fBsystem:midi_capture_\fIn\fR
.TP
\fB-v --version\fR
prints a version string (calf some.version.number)
.TP
\fB-l --load\fR \fIsession\fR
Loads the session state from a file
.TP
\fB-s --state\fR \fIsession\fR
Loads the session state from a file, if such a file exists
.TP
\fB-L --list\fR
List all available plug-ins
.TP
\fB-h -? --help\fR
prints a help text
.PP
An exclamation mark (!) in place of plugin name means automatic connection. If "!" is placed before the first plugin name, the first plugin has its inputs connected to \fBsystem:capture_1\fR
and \fBsystem:capture_2\fR. If it's placed between plugin names, those plugins are connected together (first plugin's output is connected to second
plugin's input). If it's placed after last plugin name, that plugin's audio outputs are connected to \fBsystem:playback_1\fR and \fBsystem:playback_2\fR
(first output pair). 

Plugin names (should be self-explanatory):
 * pulsator (autopanner/tremolo)
 * ringmodulator

 * reversedelay
 * compressor
 * sidechaincompressor
 * multibandcompressor
 * monocompressor
 * deesser
 * gate
 * sidechaingate
 * multibandgate
 * limiter
 * multibandlimiter
 * sidechainlimiter
 * transientdesigner
 * filterclavier (keyboard-controlled tunable filter)
 * emphasis
 * vocoder
 * eq5, eq8, eq12, eq30
 * saturator
 * crusher (bit crusher)
 * exciter
 * bassenhancer
 * stereo
 * haasenhancer
 * multispread
 * mono
 * xover2, xover3, xover4 (speaker crossovers)
 * analyzer (spectrum analyzer / spectrogram plugin)
 * flanger
 * filter
 * reverb
 * vintagedelay
 * monosynth
 * multichorus (chorus effect with multiple voices)
 * compressor (Thor Harald Johansen's dynamic compressor)
 * organ (polyphonic synthesizer emulating tonewheel or solid state organs)
 * rotaryspeaker (not a faithful emulation, not even close)

.SH EXAMPLES

To start monosynth with automatic connection to first system audio output, and no automatic MIDI connection, use:

        calfjackhost monosynth !

(! means "connect", last "!" means "connect to output")

Other examples:

        calfjackhost monosynth ! vintagedelay ! flanger ! -M 2

(runs monosynth into vintagedelay and vintagedelay into flanger, then to
output; connects monosynth's MIDI input to JACK's system:midi_capture_2)

        calfjackhost "monosynth:Fat Bass"

(runs monosynth with a Fat Bass preset into monosynth, does not autoconnect)

        calfjackhost ! reverb !

(takes signal from system:capture_1 and _2, puts it through reverb, and then
sends to system:playback_1 and _2)

Note: none of the automatic connection features will work if autoconnection
is disabled for session management purposes.
