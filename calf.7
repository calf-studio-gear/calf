.B \ How to use Calf plugins:
.TP
.B \ * LV2 plugins
Calf is installed as calf.lv2 library in your LV2 directory (typically
/usr/lib/lv2). It means that typical LV2 hosts should be able to find
Calf's plugins.

.TP
.B \ * JACK client application
You can also use Calf plugins as one or more separate applications, connecting
to other applications using JACK Audio Connection Kit (version 0.103 or newer
is required). To run the client, type:

        calfjackhost monosynth !

(! means "connect", last "!" means "connect to output")

Other examples:

        calfjackhost monosynth ! vintagedelay ! flanger !

(runs monosynth into vintagedelay and vintagedelay into flanger, then to
output)

        calfjackhost ! reverb !

(takes signal from system:capture_1 and _2, puts it through reverb, and then
sends to system:playback_1 and _2)
