            <h2>Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                Monosynth is a simple "virtual analogue" monophonic synthesizer. It consists of the following parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two oscillators, each capable of producing one of several waveforms, with minimal amount of aliasing</li>
                        <li>Most of the waveforms can be modified using the Pulse Width setting. The exact effect varies between waveforms, but it can be used to create PWM or chorus-style effects with single oscillator.
                        <li>One of the oscillators (Osc1) can also stretch its waveform to mimic an effect of a two-oscillator 'hard sync' circuitry from some analogue synthesizers.
                        <li>A filter capable of operating in several modes (12dB lowpass, 24dB lowpass, 12dB highpass, stereo 12dB lowpass, two types of bandpass and a combination of a notch filter and either LP or HP filter)
                        <li>Two ADSFR envelope generators, which can be used for either sustained or fading envelopes.
                        <li>Two low frequency oscillators
                        <li>A number of fixed modulations for the most commonly used routings, plus a versatile modulation matrix for less frequently used ones
                        <li>Portamento function
                    </ul>
            </p><h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use "Note velocity - To Cutoff" setting for bubbly velocity-sensitive bass sounds (sometimes referred to as acid bass).
                <li>Use "Note velocity - To Amp" setting to make notes louder or softer depending on velocity. Or set both Note velocity settings to 0% to simulate a synth keyboard without velocity sensing.
                <li>The easiest way to achieve a vibrato effect is to use the "LFO1 - To pitch" setting. The more difficult way is by using either of the LFOs and the modulation matrix.
            </ul>
