            <h2>Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                Equalizers are possibly the most used signal processors in a studio environment. With an equalizer you can <strong>alter the frequency spectrum of an instrument</strong> with different types of filters. Equalizers are used to <strong>increase or decrease the volume of different frequency ranges</strong>. You may add some presence to your track, cut unneccessary sub frequencies, make "room" for mixing a signal with others without producing indifferent mud, brighten dull recordings or "fix" an unsatisfying but not reproducable recording - Equalizers are the <strong>swiss army knife</strong> in audio production.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>The 8 band equalizer</strong> is a great compromise between flexibility and overload. Four peak filters and fullsize bass/treble sections provide enough bands to fit the everydays needs.
