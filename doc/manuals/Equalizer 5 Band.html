            <h2>Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                Equalizers are possibly the most used signal processors in a studio environment. With an equalizer you can <strong>alter the frequency spectrum of an instrument</strong> with different types of filters. Equalizers are used to <strong>increase or decrease the volume of different frequency ranges</strong>. You may add some presence to your track, cut unneccessary sub frequencies, make "room" for mixing a signal with others without producing indifferent mud, brighten dull recordings or "fix" an unsatisfying but not reproducable recording - Equalizers are the <strong>swiss army knife</strong> in audio production.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>The 5 band equalizer</strong> is the perfect channel strip solution. A high- and lowshelf and three parametric peak filters give you enough flexibility for standard manipulations.
            </p>
            <h2>Filters</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>The Calf Equalizer 5 Band consists of two different types of filters:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shelving filters</strong>: This type of filter got it's name from it's characteristics - it looks like the shelv of a cow. A highshelf filter increases or decreases all frequencies above the center frequency equally, the lowpass does vice versa.</li>
                <li><strong>Peak filters</strong>: Peak or bell filters increase or decrease the frequencies around the center frequency. A high quality setting of this filter results in a needle while lower quality settings produce a wider bell.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Calf Equalizers are designed to give you the most control over your frequency response. The peak filters can add or subtract <strong>up to 36dB at a really high Q</strong> to your signal. This can result in a self resonating tone in comparison to a nearly complete removal of a single narrow band.
            </p>
            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Please refer to the <a href="Equalizer 12 Band.html" title="Equalizer 12 Band">Equalizer 12 Band manual</a> for more information on equalization.</strong>
            </p>
            <h2>Controls</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input L/R:</strong> The level after the input knob. The LED's flash on levels above 0dB</li>
                <li><strong>Bypass:</strong> Don't process anything, just bypass the signal</li>
                <li><strong>Input knob:</strong> Control the input level before the signal is processed</li>
                <li><strong>Output L/R:</strong> The level after processing and after the output knob. The LED's flash on levels above 0dB</li>
                <li><strong>Output knob:</strong> Control the output of the plugin - clipping could destroy your signal</li>
                <li><strong>Low/Highshelf Frequency:</strong> The center frequency of the filter</li>
                <li><strong>Low/Highshelf Level:</strong> The amount in dB's the center frequency is increased or decreased</li>
                <li><strong>Low/Highshelf Active:</strong> Power on this filter and select an operating mode. Inactive Filters don't use any CPU</li>
                <li><strong>Peak Frequency:</strong> The center frequency of the filter</li>
                <li><strong>Peak Level:</strong> The amount in dB's the center frequency is increased or decreased</li>
                <li><strong>Peak Q:</strong> The quality of the filter. Higher values create needles, lower ones bell filters</li>
                <li><strong>Peak Active:</strong> Power on this filter and select an operating mode. Inactive Filters don't use any CPU</li>
            </ul>
