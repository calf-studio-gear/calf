            <h2>Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                Calf sudiogear provides a set of useful controls for interaction. Some of them change settings of your plugins, some of them display some useful data to give you a visual feedback.
            </p>
            <h2>Knobs (1 - 4)</h2>
            <p>
                The knobs are the controls you are dealing most of the time with. They change <strong>numerical values</strong> on drag. A circle of LED's gives a fast visual control of the settting.
                <br/><br/>
                To change a value of a knob simply klick on it and keep the mouse button pressed. Start <strong>dragging in vertical direction</strong> to increase or decrease the value. <strong>Dragging the mouse horizontally</strong> changes the sensitivity of the knob. Greater distances lead to more accurate changes.
                <br/><br/>
                Holding down the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key while dragging increases the accuracy, too.
                <br/><br/>
                The value can also be changed by holding the mouse over a knob and turning the <strong>mouse wheel</strong>.
                <br/><br/>
                If you activated a knob by clicking on it the <strong>arrow up and down keys</strong> affect the value, too.
            </p>
            <h2>Buttons (5 - 9)</h2>
            <p>
                Buttons react on a single mouse click. Calf provides different types of buttons for different tasks:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Toggle buttons</strong> (5, 6): Toggle between two states that are clearly
                displayed by the luminosity of the frame and the LED</li>
                <li><strong>Click Buttons</strong> (7): Trigger a single function on click</li>
                <li><strong>Menu Buttons</strong> (8): Raise a menu to choose an option from</li>
                <li><strong>Radio buttons</strong> (9): Select one out of multiple options</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Horiz. and vert. faders (10)</h2>
            <p>
                Faders are changing a numerical value just like knobs do. You can grab the slider with the mouse and <strong>drag it along the direction</strong> of the fader to change the value.
                <br/><br/>
                If you <strong>click somewhere</strong> inbetween the slider and one end of the fader, the value jumps directly to the value equivalent of the position you pointed at.
                <br/><br/>
                The value is also affected by the <strong>mouse wheel</strong>.
                <br/><br/>
                Once you have activated a fader, hitting the <strong>up and down keys</strong> on the keyboard will also affect it's value.
            </p>
            <h2>Graphs (11)</h2>
            <p>
                These controls provide some useful information for different effects and instruments. Graphs may display a <strong>frequency response</strong> for equalizers and filters or a <strong>dynamic response</strong> of compressors and gates. They may also draw <strong>LFO curves and phases or waveforms</strong> of synthesizers.
                <br/><br/>
                Graphs are the most accurate tool to control your settings on a visual base, they don't take any user action.
            </p>
            <h2>VU-meters (12)</h2>
            <p>
                These displays give you an oversight over <strong>levels</strong> in Calf (since they don't draw any numerical values by now). They can show in and out levels or gain reduction in dynamic processors.
            </p>
            <h2>LED's (13)</h2>
            <p>
                These tiny lights can display different kinds of information. Sometimes they act in a simple on/off state, other effects use them to display off/on/over states or they may be used to provide dynamic states like the position of an LFO.
