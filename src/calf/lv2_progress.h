/**
 * @file lv2_progress.h
 * @brief LV2 progress notification extension definition
 *
 * @par Purpose and scope
 * The purpose of this extension is to prevent thread (often the main one)
 * freeze for plugins doing intensive computations during instantiation.
 * Host may want to display progress bar of some sort and if it is using
 * GUI toolkit event loop, to dispatch queued events.
 *
 * @par
 * Using this extension for reporting progress of other lengthy operations
 * is possible and encouraged but not subject of this extension alone.
 * It is probably not good idea to call progress callback from plugin created
 * thread nor it is good idea to call it from a LV2 audio class function.
 * Any extension that wants to work in conjunction with progress extension
 * must define thread context semantics for calling the progress callback.
 *
 * @par Plugin instantiation progress usage
 * Plugin calls the host provided callback on regular basis during
 * instantiation. One second between calls is good target. Everything between
 * half second and two seconds should provide enough motion so user does
 * not get "the thing froze" impression.
